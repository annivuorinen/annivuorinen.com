Currently, I am studying at Aalto University. I completed my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science in November and continued with my Master’s studies, majoring in Software Engineering. In addition to studying, I am working with helping companies to increase their automation capabilities. This involves planning, developing and testing different robotic process automation solutions: a task that requires both technical skills and an understanding of business benefits.

In general, I am interested in software and computer science as a tool to improve the world in which we live in. As the society around us becomes more and more digital, I think it is essential to understand how technology drives development. This is the main reason why I started studying computer science: my main interest is seeing how to use software to build something concrete that has an impact on real life companies and people.

PS. In my free time I enjoy hiking, this picture is taken by me from the Torronsuo National Park.
