In this blog post, I will discuss what I learned about DevOps during this course and what I found most challenging.

The most challenging part for me was understanding DevOps on the whole and how it can be effectively used in projects – and I am not going to lie, this is still challenging for me to grasp but I feel that this course has helped me in understanding DevOps significantly more than what I did two months ago. The whole concept of DevOps was new to me when I started the course – of course, I had heard the term and knew it was coined from “software development” and “IT operations”. However, the practices relating to DevOps were completely unknown to me as well as what the term meant in practice. During this course I learned why DevOps is needed and what its benefits are. This was also the most interesting part of this course for me – relating the software aspect of DevOps with the business benefits. I was able to reflect on the material videos by pondering how the different things – such as the CAMS model – could be applied at my own workplace.

The least challenging part of the course for me was using GitHub – whilst I cannot say I was used to using it or that I had no troubles, I feel I picked it up fast. Creating a website was a lot easier than what I thought – in comparison to for example the project that I created with a team during last year’s Software Project course. (Of course, these projects were of very different size.)

In conclusion, the most valuable thing that I learned during this course was to understand DevOps as a concept and what its benefits are. For me, this course served as a starting point: I now have an elementary understanding and I can learn more. And of course, I now have a personal website that I plan to develop further!
