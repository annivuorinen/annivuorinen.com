In this blog post, I will describe why I decided to take this course on DevOps and what I expected to learn.

I first heard about this course last year when I was taking the Software Project course as a part of my Bachelor’s degree studies. However, the time to enrol had already passed but I decided to take this course later if possible. The main reason why I wanted to take this course was to understand DevOps in practice as well as to learn how to use GitHub. While I am not planning to code for a living, I thought that having an elementary understanding of how to use GitHub and how DevOps is related to a relatively small project such as this one would be very beneficial in the future. Also, a nice plus why I decided to take this course was that I have been planning to create a website for myself for a while now, so this course was perfect in that regard as well.

During the course I expected to learn how to use GitHub better – I have had my GitHub account for a while now, but since coding is not a hobby of mine, I have not created any projects. Hence, this was my first project and I expected to also to learn how to set up a new project. A second thing I expected to learn (or strengthen my knowledge of) was how to use branches and use the terminal when creating the websites – I used these during the Software Project of last year, but have not used them since so a refreshment to my memory was welcome. Thirdly I expected to learn, as mentioned, more about DevOps in practice.

In conclusion, I decided to take this course as I felt that this is a good opportunity to combine my personal goal of creating a website for myself as well as the learning goals of the course to learn more about DevOps.
