      <description>In this blog post, I will discuss what I learned about DevOps during this course and what I found most challenging.
The most challenging part for me was understanding DevOps on the whole and how it can be effectively used in projects – and I am not going to lie, this is still challenging for me to grasp but I feel that this course has helped me in understanding DevOps significantly more than what I did two months ago.</description>

      <description>In this blog post, I will describe why I decided to take this course on DevOps and what I expected to learn.
I first heard about this course last year when I was taking the Software Project course as a part of my Bachelor’s degree studies. However, the time to enrol had already passed but I decided to take this course later if possible. The main reason why I wanted to take this course was to understand DevOps in practice as well as to learn how to use GitHub.</description>
