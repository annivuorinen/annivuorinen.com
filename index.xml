      <description>In this blog post, I will discuss what I learned about DevOps during this course and what I found most challenging.
The most challenging part for me was understanding DevOps on the whole and how it can be effectively used in projects â€“ and I am not going to lie, this is still challenging for me to grasp but I feel that this course has helped me in understanding DevOps significantly more than what I did two months ago.</description>
